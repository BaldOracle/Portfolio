      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p> 
          A long, long, long, long time ago, I was born in a big city in the small state of New Jersey. A long, long time
          I moved to Georgia with my mom and brother. While in the great state of Georgia, I completed middle school and 
          high school. After high school, I went to Valdosta State University and earned my bachelor's in mathematics. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While in college, I met my AWESOME wife (Tell her I said that if you ever meet her) and started my Great family. 
          I am a father of two and currently an Operations Manager with Target. I am now taking a coding boot camp and looking
          forward to the opportunities available when I finish.
