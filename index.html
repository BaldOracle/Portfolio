        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            A long, long, long, long time ago, I was born in a big city in the
            small state of New Jersey. A long, long time I moved to Georgia with
            my mom and brother. While in the great state of Georgia, I completed
            my shooling including a bachelor's in mathematics at Valdosta State
            University.
          </p>
          <p>
            While in college, I met my AWESOME wife (Tell her I said that if you
            ever meet her) and started my Great family. I am a father of two and
            currently an Operations Manager with Target.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a software developer with a background in full-stack development,
            I have gained valuable experience in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript,
            APIs, Node, Express, SQL, NoSQL, and React. During my certificate
            program, I worked on a variety of projects, including a random
            password generator, server-side applications, a daily planner, GPS
            tracking, and weather forecasting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my experience, I have developed a strong foundation in both
            front-end and back-end development, as well as the ability to
            collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. While my
            professional experience may be limited, I am passionate about
            software development and eager to continue learning and growing in
            this field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my certificate experience, I am always seeking
            opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am an avid reader
            of industry publications and blogs, and I enjoy participating in
            online coding communities and meetups to connect with other
            developers and stay up-to-date on the latest trends and best
            practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I am confident in my ability to contribute to a team as a
            software developer, and I am committed to working hard and
            continuing to develop my skills in order to achieve success in this
            field.
